Project Breakdown!!

We wanted to make a bubble particle system that did the following:
	- Spawn bubbles of random color, size, and velocity from the canvas center
	- Clicking on any bubble will create a "pop" sound and make it disappear
	- The pop sounds will depend on the visual properties of the bubbles
		-> Size directly proportional to volume
		-> Color affects frequency

How we broke down the process:
0. Designed a bubble class to hold properties like position, velocity, color, image, sound, etc...
1. Made a collection of bubbles and make sure we were properly drawing / updating by iterating over the vector.
2. Made the bubbles move
3. Bubbles are deleted upon leaving the screen or user clicking
4. Randomize the properties of bubbles on creation
5. Associate sounds with the bubbles' properties - made the sound play on click 
6. Make new bubbles spawn when old bubbles are deleted
7. Create the flashing background using ping-ponging color lerp.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Put the .cpp and .h source files in the src folder of an OF application
Put the image and sound file in bin/data
