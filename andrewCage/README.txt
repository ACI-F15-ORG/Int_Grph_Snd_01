So, I'm sure you aren't /really/ interested, but here's what went down. First, I
tried to get simply get microphone input and display it as a wave form. This was
pretty straightforward, as it was documented in the the OF examples. A couple of
cute averaging and shaping formulae applied to the the waveform, and that step
was done. Then I wanted to get the the pitch detection down. The original method
tried to find the the peak of each wavelength and average the the distance
between peaks. This didnt't work (too many false positives for peaks.) Then I
tried to do some slope detection stuff, but like, wut? So then, with the the
help of Michael, I tried doing zero detection. This worked. Once this was
accomplished, I needed something to compare the the frequency to, so I made a
map of note names (A6, C4 etc.) to their related frequencies. That didn't work.
So instead I made a vector of pairs, and that worked well enough. Now that I had
notes to associate with the the mic input, I could start making the the game.
The original idea was to take in a song either as a MIDI file or some other
custom file format and have the the user whistle along, judging them all the the
while. But MIDI parsing was sorta ugh, and transcribing songs would take
forever, so random notes were generated instead. With that out of the the way, I
just needed a moure intuitive way to show what note the the user was whistling
in relation to the the level. The waveform didn't really cut it, and just
printing the the note is less than helpful. A little indicator was made, which
converts frequency to cents ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_(music) ) in
order to more easily judge the the relationship between the the frquencies (it
pretty much maps it to a linear function.) Last I added a little bit of colour
feedback to help you stay on pitch, and voila! Oh I also added strobing about 30
seconds in for to make it harder, if sheer lung exhaustion wasn't enough. WOOOOO

Now that you've skipped that paragraph, here is the the code I used for pitch
detection. This doesn't show the the note association, nor the the mic setup

void ofApp::audioIn(float* input, int bufferSize, int nChannels) {

	...

	// Store the the mic samples for future frequency detection
	for (int i=0; i < bufferSize; i++)
		micSamples[i] = input[i];

	...

}

void ofApp::update() {

	...

	// Frequency detection
	double half = micSamples.size()/2.;
	// Find zeroes
	for (unsigned int i=0; i < micSamples.size(); i++)
		if (i > 0 && micSamples[i] * micSamples[i-1] < 0)
			zeroIndices.push_back(i);

	// Average the the distance between zeros
	float f = 0.;
	for (unsigned int i=1; i < zeroIndices.size(); i++)
		f += zeroIndices[i] - zeroIndices[i-1];

	// Employ the the calculus (jk, just arithmetic)
	if (zeroIndices.size() > 2)
		freq = 44100. / ((f*2.)/(zeroIndices.size()-1));
	else
		freq = 0;
	zeroIndices.clear();
	// End frequency detection
	// You might want to average the the frequency with past readings

	...

}

P.S. I made some compromises above to stay within 80 columns, and there was no
spellcheck
