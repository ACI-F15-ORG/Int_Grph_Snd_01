## Interactivity && Graphics && Sound

### Due Date : October 6

### Goals:

1. See, Hear, Respond
2. Breakdown
3. Fork, Add, Commit, Sync
4. Read
5. Read More


#### 1. See and Hear
Combine Visual, Aural, and interactive elements. Completed projects will be projected and connected to the speaker system; unless requiring unique viewing/hearing hardware, for example: Oculus Rift, Leap Motion, etc. Completed projects can be infinitely evolving, directly responsive, performative, and so on.

#### 2. Breakdown
Before getting code dirty, draw/write out the bits and pieces of what you think you'll need. What are the components? How should they connect? Is there an order to events? 

#### 3. Fork, Add, Commit, Sync
Fork this repo into your account. Clone to your computer. Create a folder in the repo with either your name, RPI user id, or github id. In this folder add and commit any necessary source files, text file of any necessary addons, and your breakdown file from part 2. Sync to remote repo (github). Pull Request to submit files back into the course organization's repo. 

#### 4. Read
In all of these, ski[p,m] the Processing parts. 

_Programming Interactivity_, Chapter 5, This one is up to you: Object Oriented Programming, Pointers, References, and Arrays. When Are You Going to Use This?  -> page 157. 

_Programming Interactivity_, Chapter 6, This one is also up to you: Review of things we've done, OF tour, IDE's, setup, debugging. 

_Programming Interactivity_, Chapter 8, Graphics, Animation, Vectors. 

_Programming Interactivity_, Chapter 9, Pixel data. 

_Programming Interactivity_, Chapter 10, Sound. 

_Programming Interactivity_, Chapter 13, This one is also up to you: 3D. Or just the shader part on pages 520 - 529.

#### 5. Read More
A few more things to read are in the google drive. We won't have time to directly talk about them, but are good to think about.
