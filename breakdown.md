# Breakdown
"You create the world, and then you destroy it"
 - Similar to another project I did (Just Keep Yelling)
 - Move around a world (in first person?) and create items in the world
 - Afterwards, you run around the world, yelling into a mic, creating a black hole that imparts a gravitational force on all the local items in the world.
 - Maybe 2D since bullet isn't working?

 I need:
 - sound processing
 - Box2D
 - I guess that's it
